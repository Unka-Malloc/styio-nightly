# Team Runbook Document Stats

**Purpose:** Record the current size of each `docs/teams/` runbook using the repository-local `scripts/docs-audit.py` word-count and character-count rules; this is a maintenance snapshot, not a quality target.

**Last updated:** 2026-10-03

## Counting Method

The numbers below use the same approximation as `scripts/docs-audit.py`:

1. Each Han character counts as 1 word.
2. Each contiguous ASCII word counts as 1 word.
3. Each non-whitespace symbol counts as 1 word.
4. `character_count` is the raw Markdown character length.

This table excludes generated [INDEX.md](./INDEX.md), collection [README.md](./README.md), and this statistics file from the team-runbook total.

Refresh command:

```bash
python3 scripts/docs-audit.py --manifest valid --format json --output /tmp/styio-docs.json
```
